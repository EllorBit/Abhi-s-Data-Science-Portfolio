### [A geographical analysis on China's Wuhan Coronavirus](https://github.com/abhihirekhan/Abhi-s-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/A%20geographical%20analysis%20on%20China's%20Wuhan%20Coronavirus) 

* 2019 Novel Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) is a virus (more specifically, a coronavirus) identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory illness first detected in Wuhan, China. Early on, many of the patients in the outbreak in Wuhan, China reportedly had some link to a large seafood and animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread. However, a growing number of patients reportedly have not had exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread is occurring. At this time, it’s unclear how easily or sustainably this virus is spreading between people - CDC.
*Wuhan Coronavirus : A geographical analysis
With the news coming in that the World Health Organization has declared the novel coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency, it has increased the general fear among the public. A lot of countires have heightened their measures to fight with this virus with the condition in China still senitive..More than 20 countries and territories outside of mainland China have confirmed cases of the virus -- spanning Asia, Europe, North America and the Middle East -- as India, Italy and the Philippines reported their first cases on Thursday

### [Corona Virus Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/abhihirekhan/Abhi-s-Data-Science-Portfolio/tree/master/Corona%20Virus%20Dataset%20Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis) 

* A SARS-like virus outbreak originating in Wuhan, China, is spreading into neighboring Asian countries, and as far afield as Australia, the US a and Europe.

On 31 December 2019, the Chinese authorities reported a case of pneumonia with an unknown cause in Wuhan, Hubei province, to the World Health Organisation (WHO)’s China Office. As more and more cases emerged, totaling 44 by 3 January, the country’s National Health Commission isolated the virus causing fever and flu-like symptoms and identified it as a novel coronavirus, now known to the WHO as 2019-nCoV.
* Only 0.4% of patient died but also only 0.7% of patient recovered and still around 98.9% of patient are under isolation.
So, the death probability is low but also recovering from this virus is difficult.
The most of the patient died within a 5 days after confirmation. So, the treatment of corona virus has to be started immediately after confirmation as it's impact is really hazardous.
The patient with age between 35 and 45 years is more likely to get released but this is not true in all cases.
Most of the patient with age greater than 55 couldn't survived from this virus.
*So, even though death percentage is low but recovering from this virus is difficult.
